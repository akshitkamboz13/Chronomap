CHAPTER 7: FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION

7.1 Web Client Structure

The web client implementation follows a component-based architecture using React.js, with a focus on reusability, maintainability, and performance. The application is structured into logical directories that separate concerns and promote code organization.

7.1.1 Project Structure

```
client/
├── public/
│   └── icons/       # Theme-specific icons
│       ├── cyberpunk/
│       ├── gta v/
│       ├── rdr2/
│       └── test/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/      # Static assets and resources
│   ├── components/  # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── drawers/ # Sliding panel components

│   └── utils/       # Helper functions and services
├── package.json     # Dependencies and scripts
└── vite.config.js   # Build configuration
```

7.1.2 Core Components

The application is built using a hierarchy of components with specific responsibilities:

- **App Component**: Root component handling routing, authentication state, and theme context
- **Map Component**: Core interactive map with theme-specific styling
- **MarkerManager**: Handles marker rendering, clustering, and interaction
- **ThemeSwitcher**: UI component for changing the map theme
- **Sidebar/Header**: Navigation and control components
- **MarkerDetailDrawer**: Slide-in panel showing marker details
- **AuthForms**: Login and registration components

7.1.3 State Management

State management is implemented using a combination of:

- **React Context API**: For global application state such as authentication and current theme
- **Local Component State**: For component-specific UI states
- **Custom Hooks**: For encapsulating complex state logic and side effects

Example of the Theme Context implementation:

```jsx
// ThemeContext.js
const ThemeContext = createContext();

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [currentTheme, setCurrentTheme] = useState('gta v');
  const [themes, setThemes] = useState({});
  
  // Fetch available themes on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchThemes = async () => {
      const response = await api.getThemes();
      setThemes(response.data);
    };
    fetchThemes();
  }, []);
  
  // Apply theme changes to document
  useEffect(() => {
    document.documentElement.className = `theme-${currentTheme}`;
  }, [currentTheme]);
  
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ currentTheme, setCurrentTheme, themes }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

7.2 Theme Implementation

The theming system is a core feature of Mappp, allowing users to switch between visual styles inspired by different games. The implementation combines several technical approaches to achieve a seamless theming experience.

7.2.1 Theme Architecture

Each theme consists of:

- **Color Palette**: Game-specific colors for UI elements, text, and map features
- **Typography**: Custom fonts that match the game's aesthetic
- **Icons**: Theme-specific marker and UI icons
- **Map Styles**: Custom map tile styling to match the game world
- **UI Components**: Styled components reflecting the game's interface design

7.2.2 CSS Implementation

Themes are primarily implemented through:

- **Tailwind CSS Extensions**: The Tailwind configuration extends the default theme with game-specific colors and design tokens:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'gta-dark': '#1a1a1a',
        'gta-primary': '#00ccff',
        'gta-secondary': '#ff00cc',
        
        'rdr2-dark': '#40423D',
        'rdr2-primary': '#C8B28D',
        'rdr2-secondary': '#DEC29B',
        
        'cyberpunk-dark': '#0d0d1a',
        'cyberpunk-primary': '#ffff00',
        'cyberpunk-secondary': '#ff00ff',
      },
      fontFamily: {
        'rdr2-state': ['Merriweather', 'serif'],
        'rdr2-city': ['Raleway', 'sans-serif'],
        // Additional font definitions
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic variables switched at runtime:

```css
/* Base theme variables */
:root {
  --font-primary: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  --color-background: #242424;
  --color-text: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87);
}

/* RDR2 Theme */
.theme-rdr2 {
  --font-state: 'Merriweather', serif;
  --font-city: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
  --color-land: #DEC29B;
  --color-ink: #40423D;
  --color-water: #9E9985;
}

/* GTA V Theme */
.theme-gta-v {
  --font-primary: 'Chakra Petch', sans-serif;
  --color-primary: #00ccff;
  --color-secondary: #ff00cc;
  --color-background: #1a1a1a;
}
```

7.2.3 Theme Switching Mechanism

The theme switching functionality is implemented as follows:

1. User selects a theme from the ThemeSwitcher component
2. Theme context is updated with the new theme name
3. CSS class is applied to the root element
4. Theme-specific assets (fonts, icons) are loaded dynamically
5. Map tiles are reloaded with the new style configuration

7.2.4 Asset Management

Each theme has its own set of assets:

- **Icon Sets**: Stored in theme-specific directories
- **Map Tile Styles**: Custom map styles created for each theme
- **Web Fonts**: Loaded conditionally based on active theme

7.3 Marker Placement System

The marker system allows users to place, edit, and view location markers on the map with theme-specific styling and real-time synchronization.

7.3.1 Marker Data Structure

Each marker is represented by:

```typescript
interface Marker {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  coordinates: [number, number]; // [latitude, longitude]
  icon: string;
  category?: string;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

7.3.2 Marker Creation Flow

The marker creation process follows these steps:

1. User clicks on the map or selects "Add Marker" button
2. Marker creation form is displayed with fields for title, description, and icon
3. User submits the form which triggers an API call to create the marker
4. Backend saves the marker and broadcasts a WebSocket event
5. All connected clients receive the new marker and update their map

7.3.3 Marker Interaction

Markers support the following interactions:

- **Click**: Opens marker details drawer
- **Drag**: Repositions marker (for marker owners only)
- **Context Menu**: Provides options like edit, delete, share
- **Hover**: Shows tooltip with basic marker information

7.3.4 Custom Icons

The application supports custom marker icons:

- Theme-specific icon sets stored in the public directory
- Icon selection UI in the marker creation form
- Dynamic loading based on the current theme
- Fallback icons for cross-theme compatibility

7.3.5 Real-time Updates

Marker changes are synchronized in real-time:

```javascript
// In MarkerContext.jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Connect to WebSocket
  const socket = io(API_URL);
  
  // Listen for marker events
  socket.on('markerCreated', (marker) => {
    setMarkers((prev) => [...prev, marker]);
  });
  
  socket.on('markerUpdated', (updatedMarker) => {
    setMarkers((prev) => 
      prev.map(m => m.id === updatedMarker.id ? updatedMarker : m)
    );
  });
  
  socket.on('markerDeleted', (markerId) => {
    setMarkers((prev) => prev.filter(m => m.id !== markerId));
  });
  
  return () => socket.disconnect();
}, []);
```

7.4 Responsive Design

The application is designed to work seamlessly across devices of various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.

7.4.1 Mobile-First Approach

Development followed a mobile-first approach, with:

- Base styles designed for mobile screens
- Media queries for progressively enhancing larger screens
- Touch-friendly controls with appropriate sizing
- Simplified layout for smaller screens

7.4.2 Responsive Layout Techniques

The following techniques were employed:

- **Flexbox and CSS Grid**: For flexible, responsive layouts
- **Percentage-based Widths**: To allow elements to resize fluidly
- **Media Queries**: For targeted style adjustments at specific breakpoints
- **Tailwind's Responsive Classes**: For convenient responsive design

```css
/* Example of responsive component styling */
.sidebar {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%; /* Full width on mobile */
  
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    width: 320px; /* Fixed width on desktop */
    box-shadow: 2px 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  }
}
```

7.4.3 Accessibility Considerations

The application incorporates accessibility best practices:

- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA attributes for improved screen reader experience
- Keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Focus states for interactive elements
- Alt text for images and icons

7.5 Performance Optimization

Several techniques were employed to ensure optimal performance:

7.5.1 Code Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: Using dynamic imports to reduce initial bundle size
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and routes loaded only when needed
- **Memoization**: Using React.memo and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Virtualization**: For efficiently rendering large lists of markers

7.5.2 Asset Optimization

- **Image Compression**: Optimized images for faster loading
- **Icon Fonts/SVGs**: Lightweight vector graphics for icons
- **Bundle Size Management**: Regular analysis and optimization of package size
- **Cache Strategies**: Appropriate cache headers for static assets

7.6 Testing Strategy

The frontend implementation was tested using:

7.6.1 Unit Tests
- Component rendering tests with React Testing Library
- Logic verification for utility functions
- Mock testing for API interactions

7.6.2 Integration Tests
- Component interaction tests
- Form submission flows
- Theme switching behavior

7.6.3 User Testing
- Usability testing with representative users
- Cross-browser compatibility verification
- Mobile device testing

CHAPTER 8: BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION

8.1 API Design

The backend API follows RESTful principles with a focus on simplicity, security, and performance. It provides the necessary endpoints for client applications to interact with the system.

8.1.1 API Architecture

The API is organized around resources with standard HTTP methods:

- **GET**: Retrieve resources
- **POST**: Create new resources
- **PUT/PATCH**: Update existing resources
- **DELETE**: Remove resources

8.1.2 Endpoint Structure

```
/api
  /auth
    POST /register     # Create a new user account
    POST /login        # Authenticate and receive JWT
    GET /profile       # Get current user profile
    PUT /profile       # Update user profile
  
  /markers
    GET /              # Get all markers (with filtering options)
    POST /             # Create a new marker
    GET /:id           # Get a specific marker
    PUT /:id           # Update a marker
    DELETE /:id        # Delete a marker
    
  /themes
    GET /              # List all available themes
    GET /:id           # Get a specific theme's details
    
  /icons
    GET /              # List all available icon sets
    GET /:theme        # Get icons for a specific theme
```

8.1.3 Request/Response Format

All API communication uses JSON format:

```json
// Example marker response
{
  "id": "60f7b3c42c21d30b5e9b4e7a",
  "title": "Ammunition Shop",
  "description": "Buy weapons and ammo here",
  "coordinates": [34.052235, -118.243683],
  "icon": "gun-store",
  "category": "shops",
  "createdBy": "user123",
  "createdAt": "2023-07-21T14:23:00.000Z"
}
```

8.1.4 Authentication System

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication:

1. Client provides credentials to the login endpoint
2. Server validates credentials and issues a signed JWT
3. Client includes the JWT in the Authorization header of subsequent requests
4. Server validates the token and grants access to protected resources

Example authentication flow:

```javascript
// Server-side login endpoint
app.post('/api/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  
  // Validate credentials
  const user = await User.findOne({ email });
  if (!user || !await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password)) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
  }
  
  // Generate JWT token
  const token = jwt.sign(
    { userId: user._id, role: user.role },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '24h' }
  );
  
  res.json({ token, userId: user._id });
});

// Authentication middleware
const authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const token = req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1];
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.userData = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication failed' });
  }
};
```

8.1.5 Error Handling

The API implements standardized error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required
- **403 Forbidden**: Permission denied
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side issues

Error responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "details": [
    "Additional information about the error"
  ]
}
```

8.2 Database Schema

The application uses MongoDB as the primary database, with a document-oriented schema design that provides flexibility while maintaining data integrity.

8.2.1 User Schema

```javascript
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
    trim: true,
    minlength: 3,
    maxlength: 20
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
    trim: true,
    lowercase: true,
    match: [/^\S+@\S+\.\S+$/, 'Please use a valid email address']
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 8
  },
  role: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['user', 'moderator', 'admin'],
    default: 'user'
  },
  avatarUrl: String,
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  },
  lastLogin: Date,
  preferences: {
    defaultTheme: {
      type: String,
      default: 'gta v'
    },
    notifications: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: true
    }
  }
});
```

Password hashing is implemented using a pre-save hook:

```javascript
UserSchema.pre('save', async function(next) {
  if (!this.isModified('password')) return next();
  
  try {
    this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 12);
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});
```

8.2.2 Marker Schema

```javascript
const MarkerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
    maxlength: 100
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
    trim: true,
    maxlength: 500
  },
  coordinates: {
    type: [Number], // [latitude, longitude]
    required: true,
    validate: {
      validator: function(v) {
        return v.length === 2 && 
               v[0] >= -90 && v[0] <= 90 && 
               v[1] >= -180 && v[1] <= 180;
      },
      message: 'Invalid coordinates format'
    },
    index: '2dsphere' // Geospatial index
  },
  icon: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  category: {
    type: String,
    default: 'misc'
  },
  createdBy: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User',
    required: true
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  },
  updatedAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  },
  visibility: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['public', 'private', 'shared'],
    default: 'public'
  },
  sharedWith: [{
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User'
  }]
});

// Update timestamp on save
MarkerSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  this.updatedAt = Date.now();
  next();
});
```

8.2.3 Theme Schema

```javascript
const ThemeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
    lowercase: true,
    trim: true
  },
  displayName: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  description: String,
  colors: {
    primary: String,
    secondary: String,
    background: String,
    text: String,
    accent: String
  },
  fonts: {
    primary: String,
    secondary: String
  },

8.3 Real-time Updates

Real-time functionality is implemented using Socket.IO to enable instant updates across connected clients.

8.3.1 WebSocket Architecture

The WebSocket server is integrated with the Express.js application:

```javascript
// Initialize HTTP server and Socket.IO
const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIO(server);

// Socket.IO authentication middleware
io.use((socket, next) => {
  if (socket.handshake.query && socket.handshake.query.token) {
    jwt.verify(socket.handshake.query.token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
      if (err) return next(new Error('Authentication error'));
      socket.decoded = decoded;
      next();
    });
  } else {
    next(new Error('Authentication error'));
  }
});
```

8.3.2 Event Handling

Socket.IO events are organized around marker actions:

```javascript
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log(`User connected: ${socket.decoded.userId}`);
  
  // Join rooms based on theme
  socket.on('joinTheme', (theme) => {
    socket.join(theme);
    console.log(`User ${socket.decoded.userId} joined theme: ${theme}`);
  });
  
  // Handle marker creation
  socket.on('createMarker', async (markerData) => {
    try {
      const marker = new Marker({
        ...markerData,
        createdBy: socket.decoded.userId
      });
      
      await marker.save();
      
      // Broadcast to all clients in the theme room
      io.to(markerData.theme).emit('markerCreated', marker);
    } catch (error) {
      socket.emit('error', error.message);
    }
  });
  
  // Handle marker updates and deletion
  socket.on('updateMarker', async (markerData) => {
    // Update marker and broadcast changes
  });
  
  socket.on('deleteMarker', async (markerId) => {
    // Delete marker and broadcast deletion
  });
  
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log(`User disconnected: ${socket.decoded.userId}`);
  });
});
```

8.3.3 Client Synchronization

The server implements mechanisms to ensure clients stay synchronized:

1. Initial data load when clients connect
2. Real-time updates for changes made by other users

```

9.1.2 Shared Logic with Web Client

To maximize code reusability between web and native clients, the following approach was implemented:

1. **Shared Business Logic**: Core functionality extracted into platform-agnostic modules
2. **Common Data Models**: Consistent data structures across platforms
3. **API Service Layer**: Unified API client with platform-specific adaptations
4. **Utility Functions**: Shared helper functions for common operations

Example of shared service implementation:

```javascript
// Shared API service with platform-specific adaptations
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = Platform.OS === 'web' 
  ? '/api' 
  : 'https://mappp-server.example.com/api';

export const api = {
  getMarkers: async (bounds) => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/markers`, {
        params: { bounds }
      });
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching markers:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  },
  
  // Other API methods...
};
```

9.2 Platform-Specific Implementation

The notification system uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for cross-platform delivery:

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│              │     │                │     │               │
│ Backend API  ├────▶│ Firebase Cloud ├────▶│ User Devices  │
│              │     │ Messaging      │     │               │
└──────────────┘     └────────────────┘     └───────────────┘
```

9.3.2 Implementation

```javascript
// Notification setup
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

// Request user permission
const requestUserPermission = async () => {
  const authStatus = await messaging().requestPermission();
  const enabled =
    authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.AUTHORIZED ||
    authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL;

  if (enabled) {
    console.log('Authorization status:', authStatus);
    return true;
  }
  return false;
};

// Register device for notifications
const registerDeviceForNotifications = async (userId) => {
  try {
    await messaging().registerDeviceForRemoteMessages();
    const token = await messaging().getToken();
    
    // Send token to backend
    await api.registerPushToken(userId, token);
    
    // Save token locally
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('pushToken', token);
    
    console.log('FCM Token:', token);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to register for notifications', error);
  }
};

// Handle incoming notifications
messaging().onMessage(async remoteMessage => {
  console.log('Notification received in foreground!', remoteMessage);
  // Process notification data
});

messaging().setBackgroundMessageHandler(async remoteMessage => {
  console.log('Message handled in the background!', remoteMessage);
  // Process background notification
});
```

9.3.3 Notification Types

The system supports various types of notifications:

  try {
    // Check for connectivity
    const isConnected = await NetInfo.fetch().then(state => state.isConnected);
    
    if (!isConnected) return;
    
    // Get pending changes from local storage
    const pendingChanges = await AsyncStorage.getItem('pendingChanges');
    
    if (!pendingChanges) return;
    
    const changes = JSON.parse(pendingChanges);
    
    // Process each change type
    if (changes.markers) {
      for (const marker of changes.markers) {
        if (marker.action === 'create') {
          await api.createMarker(marker.data);
        } else if (marker.action === 'update') {
          await api.updateMarker(marker.id, marker.data);
        } else if (marker.action === 'delete') {
          await api.deleteMarker(marker.id);
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Clear pending changes after successful sync
    await AsyncStorage.removeItem('pendingChanges');

The development of the Mappp application presented numerous technical and design challenges. This chapter outlines the major challenges encountered during the development process and the innovative solutions implemented to overcome them.

12.1 Map Performance Optimization

12.1.1 Challenge: Rendering Numerous Markers

The application needed to display hundreds of markers simultaneously without compromising performance, particularly on lower-end devices and mobile platforms.

**Symptoms:**
- Frame rate drops when displaying many markers (50+ markers)
- Sluggish interaction when panning/zooming with markers visible
- High memory consumption leading to potential crashes on mobile devices
- Long initial load times when accessing maps with many markers

12.1.2 Solution: Advanced Rendering Optimization

Several techniques were implemented to address these performance issues:

**Marker Virtualization**
- Only rendering markers currently visible in the viewport
- Implementing spatial indexing for efficient marker querying
- Using marker placeholders for out-of-view markers

**Rendering Optimization**
```javascript
// Optimized marker rendering with virtualization
const MapContainer = () => {
  const mapRef = useRef(null);
  const [visibleBounds, setVisibleBounds] = useState(null);
  const markers = useMarkers();
  
  // Update visible bounds when map moves
  const handleMoveEnd = () => {
    if (mapRef.current) {
      setVisibleBounds(mapRef.current.getBounds());
    }
  };
  
  // Filter markers to show only those in view
  const visibleMarkers = useMemo(() => {
    if (!visibleBounds || !markers) return [];
    
    return markers.filter(marker => 
      isPointInBounds(marker.coordinates, visibleBounds)
    );
  }, [markers, visibleBounds]);
  
  return (
    <Map ref={mapRef} onMoveEnd={handleMoveEnd}>
      {/* Only render markers in the current view */}
      {visibleMarkers.map(marker => (
        <Marker key={marker.id} position={marker.coordinates} />
      ))}
    </Map>
  );
};
```

  --color-primary: #00ccff;
  --color-secondary: #ff00cc;
  --font-heading: 'Chakra Petch', sans-serif;
  --border-radius: 0px;
}

/* Red Dead Theme */
.theme-rdr2 {
  --color-primary: #C8B28D;
  --color-secondary: #40423D;
  --font-heading: 'Merriweather', serif;
  --border-radius: 0px;
}
```

**Context-based Theme Management**
- React Context API for theme state management
- Centralized theme configuration store

// ThemeContext implementation
export const ThemeContext = createContext();

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [currentTheme, setCurrentTheme] = useState(getDefaultTheme());
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  
  // Handle theme change
  const changeTheme = useCallback(async (themeName) => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    
    try {
      // Load theme assets
      await loadThemeAssets(themeName);
      
      // Update document class
      document.documentElement.className = `theme-${themeName}`;
      
      // Save theme preference
      localStorage.setItem('preferred-theme', themeName);
      
      // Update theme state
      setCurrentTheme(themeName);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load theme:', error);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }, []);
  
  // Context value
  const value = {
    currentTheme,
    changeTheme,
    isLoading
  };
  
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

      this.isConnected = true;
      this.processQueue();
      this.emit('requestSync');
    });
    
    this.socket.on('disconnect', () => {
      this.isConnected = false;
    });
    
    // Custom reconnection logic
    this.socket.io.on('reconnect_attempt', () => {
      console.log('Attempting to reconnect...');
    });
    
    this.socket.io.on('reconnect', () => {

    });
    
    // Handle marker events
    this.socket.on('markerCreated', this.onMarkerCreated);
    this.socket.on('markerUpdated', this.onMarkerUpdated);
    this.socket.on('markerDeleted', this.onMarkerDeleted);
  }
  
  // Queue events when offline
  emit(event, data) {
    if (this.isConnected) {
      this.socket.emit(event, data);
    } else {
      this.eventQueue.push({ event, data });
      this.saveQueue();
    }
  }
  
  // Process queued events when connection is restored
  processQueue() {
    if (!this.isConnected) return;
    
    const queue = [...this.eventQueue];
    this.eventQueue = [];
    
    queue.forEach(item => {
      this.socket.emit(item.event, item.data);
    });
    
    this.saveQueue();
  }
